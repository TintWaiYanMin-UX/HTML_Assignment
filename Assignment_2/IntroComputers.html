        <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">History of Computers</h4>

        <p>One of the earliest machines designed to assist people in calculations was the <b>abacus</b> which is still being used some 5000 years after its invention.</p>

        <p>In 1642 Blaise Pascal <span>&#40;</span>a famous French mathematician<span>&#41;</span> invented an adding machine based on mechanical gears in which numbers were represented by the cogs on the wheels.</p>

        <p>Englishman, Charles Babbage, invented in the 1830's a "Difference Engine" made out of brass and pewter rods and gears, and also designed a further device which he called an "Analytical Engine". His design contained the five key characteristics of modern computers:-</p>

        <ol>
            <li>An input device</li>
            <li>Storage for numbers waiting to be processed</li>
            <li>A processor or number calculator</li>
            <li>A unit to control the task and the sequence of its calculations</li>
            <li>An output device</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Augusta Ada Byron <span style="font-style: italic;"><span>&#40;</span>later Countess of Lovelace<span>&#41;</span></span> was an assocate of Baggage who has become known as the first computer programmer.</p>

            <h4>Components of Computers</h4>
    
            <h5>Central Processing Units</h5>
    
            <p>A <b>central processing unit</b><span>&#40;</span><b>CPU</b><span>&#41;</span> is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic <br>arithmetic, logic, controlling and input/output<span>&#40;</span><b>I/O</b><span>&#41;</span> operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.</p>
    
            <h5>Keyboard</h5>

                <p class="text" style="word-wrap: break-word;">A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical
                    levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via
                    teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input method for computers. Keyboard keys
                    <span>&#40;</span>buttons<span>&#41;</span> typically have characters engraved or printed on them, and each press
                    of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require pressing
                    and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or
                    signs <span>&#40;</span>characters<span>&#41;</span>, other keys or simultaneously key presses can produce
                    actions or execute computer commands. In normal usage,the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing
                    text and numbers into a word processor, text editor or any other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every
                    other key and reports all key presses to the controlling software.</p>
