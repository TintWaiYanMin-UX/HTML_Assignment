        <p>This article is about the worldwide computer network. For other uses, see Internet (disambiguation).</p>

        <p>Not to be confused with the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the
            standard Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a <span style="font-style: italic; color:brown"> network of
            networks</span> that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks
            of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking
            technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such
            as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web(WWW),
            the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.</p>
            
            <p>The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States
            government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer
            networks.[2] This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary
            precursor network, the ARPANET, in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to "the ARPA
            internet". <span style="color:red">The interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the beginning of
            the transition to the modern Internet.</span> From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained
            exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were
            connected to it.</p>
